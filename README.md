Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker | Power BI Project

Analyzed 50+ digital marketing campaigns across Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Ads, and Twitter to evaluate ROI, conversion rates, and budget efficiency.
Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that helps marketers identify:

 🔹 Which platforms deliver the highest ROI
 
 🔹 The most cost-efficient campaigns (CPC & CPA)
 
 🔹 Trends in revenue vs spend over time
 
💡 Key Insight: Instagram campaigns generated the highest ROI (204%), while Google Ads proved the most cost-effective in terms of CPC.
